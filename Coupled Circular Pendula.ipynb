    "  - Each oscillator's motion is dictated by its interaction with neighbors through coupling springs.\n",
    "  - The displacements are computed from the normal modes and visualized as oscillations around equilibrium positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Coupled Dynamics**:\n",
    "  - The coupling between oscillators results in synchronized yet distinct motion patterns.\n",
    "  - At times, oscillators move in-phase, while at others, they oscillate out-of-phase, depending on the system's mode contributions.\n",

    "### 3. Key Details in the Animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Spring Configuration**:\n",
    "- The animation dynamically updates the positions of oscillators based on their angular displacements.\n",
    "- The circular layout helps highlight the symmetry and interactions in the coupled system.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Phase Relationships**:\n",
    "- Different oscillators can oscillate with varying amplitudes and phase shifts, demonstrating the complexity of coupled motion.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Superposition of Modes**:\n",
    "- The total motion is the result of the **superposition** of individual modes, where each mode contributes to the system's behavior based on its frequency and amplitude.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Observations During the Animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Smooth Transitions**:\n",
    "  - The oscillators smoothly transition between positions, highlighting harmonic motion.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Coupling Effects**:\n",
    "  - Oscillators influence each other’s motion through their neighbors, maintaining the circular configuration.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **System Stability**:\n",
    "  - The animation provides visual feedback on the system's stability. Unstable systems would exhibit divergent motion patterns or non-periodic oscillations.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion:\n",
    "This animation visually represents the motion of coupled oscillators in a circular configuration. It highlights the complex interplay between individual angular displacements, coupling effects, and normal modes of vibration. The dynamic visualization provides a deeper understanding of how physical properties like mass, spring constants, and coupling influence the system's behavior.\n"
